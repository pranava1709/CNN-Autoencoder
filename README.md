# An-Auto-Encoder-CNN-Model-for-generating-reduced-dimensional-Images-for-Dark-Matter-Data-

Here, I have developed an autoencoder network from scratch using the basic encoder and decoder base. Using the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), feature maps were  for three main categories of the sphere, vort and nosub-structure. 

This pipeline is implemented in Keras, and the model is trained on 100 epochs. 

# Dataset

The dataset is a combination of three classes containing in total of 1200 samples.
